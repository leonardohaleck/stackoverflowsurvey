## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The libraries used in the notebook are: Pandas, Matplotlib.Pyplot and Seaborn.
The code was written using Python 3.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand this questions about 'Data Scientist and Machine Learning Specialists':

1. What are the most used technologies (Languages, Databases, Platforms, Webframeworks and Frameworks) in 2019?
2. What are the most desired technologies (Languages, Databases, Platforms, Webframeworks and Frameworks) for 2020?
3. What is the annual salary distribution and the mean salary of this professionals?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook avaiable here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
The notebook is about how I cleaned and analyzed the data to obtain my answers

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-2019).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
